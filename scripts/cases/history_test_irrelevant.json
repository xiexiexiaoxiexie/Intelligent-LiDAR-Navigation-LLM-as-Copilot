        "event_msg": "Send time: 2024-07-06 10:00\nSubject: Safety Tips to Prevent Online Scams\n\n        Dear all,\n\n        Recently, we have received reports from faculty and students that illegal addresses have been sending emails with the subject on tax refund or year-end bonus. We have verified that all these emails are phishing emails. To further improve security awareness and avoid personal financial losses, we propose the following safety tips:\n        “Three Don’ts and One Must” to prevent online scams\n\n        1. Don’t be gullible. \n        Do not trust phone calls, text messages, or emails from unknown sources.Hang up the phone immediately and do not reply to text messages or emails, so as not to give criminals any opportunity to lay further traps.\n        2. Don’t disclose any personal information. \n        Do not be tempted for thin profits. Under no circumstances should you disclose any personal and financial information of yourself and your family members to strangers. If you have any question, you can call the police for help, or check with relatives, friends, or colleagues.\n        3. Don’t transfer money to strangers.  \n        4. Report to the police promptly. \n        In case you, your family members or friends fall for scams, please report the case to police immediately and assist in the investigation.\n        Common online fraud methods on campus\n        1. Impersonation fraud\n        Pretending to be the employee of the police, the procuratorate, the court, the social security bureau or the medical insurance agency, the scammer called the victim by the make-up numbers of the above-mentioned organizations. In the name of \"malicious overdrafts, abnormalities in social security or medical insurance accounts, suspected money laundering or drug trafficking”, the scammer asked the victim to transfer money to the so-called “safe account”, or asked the victim to check the fake wanted order on the website and then set the trap.\n        2. Tax refund fraud\n        Pretending to be the employee of the department of finance, tax affairs, health, the disabled or the education, the scammer claimed that the victim was entitled to tax refund and provided a service number of the above-mentioned departments. Then the scammer coaxed the victim to make bank transfer through the so called service number.\n        3. Part-time online click farming fraud\n        The scammer posted false advertisements online, claiming \"part-time click farming with high rewards\". The scammer asked the victim to make an initial order with a small rebate, then promised more rebate as a bait for more orders from the victim.\n        4. Microfiance fraud\n        The scammer claimed to provide low-interest or interest-free loans by sending text messages or publishing false information on the Internet. The victim will be asked to transfer money to a designated account to prove the ability to repay, or to pay insurance, notary fees and other fees.\n        5. Online shopping fraud\n        The scammer illegally obtained the orders and relevant information on Taobao, JD.com and other online shopping platforms, then impersonated customer service staff to ask for bank card and Alipay information, or deceived the victim into logging on fraudulent website which will lead to transfer of funds.\n        6. AI-powered fraud\n        The scammer gained trust by imitating the voice or image of staff of \"online store customer service\", \"marketing promotion\", \"part-time job recruitment\", \"dating service\", etc. Through WeChat, QQ, phone calls, the scammer collected the victim’s voice or facial information, then used \"voice synthesis\" or \"face swapping\" technology to create fake audio, video, or images to induce the victim’s relatives and friends to transfer money or provide sensitive information such as bank account passwords, under the pretext of borrowing money, investment, emergency help.\n        Police advisory: In case of fraud/incident, please call the following number at:\n        Sunqiao Police Station quick alarm on duty: 021-xxx\n        Officer Cao in the area: xxx.\n        \n        Office of General Services"
