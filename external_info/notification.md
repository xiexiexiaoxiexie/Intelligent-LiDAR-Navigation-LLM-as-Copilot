Subject: Reminder: Graduation Party in the Lobby - Please Avoid Crowding

        Dear all,

        I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you about an upcoming event on July 7 that might affect your day-to-day activities within the building. We are hosting a graduation party in the lobby today to celebrate the achievements of our graduating members.

        As you can imagine, such events tend to draw a crowd. While we encourage everyone to join in the celebration, we also want to ensure the safety and comfort of all residents. Therefore, I kindly request that you refrain from crowding in the lobby area during the party.

        We understand that it might be tempting to gather and socialize, but considering the current circumstances, it's crucial to maintain social distancing and avoid large gatherings whenever possible. By doing so, we can ensure that everyone can enjoy the festivities safely.

        If you have any questions or concerns regarding this event, please feel free to reach out to me or the organizing committee. Your cooperation and understanding are greatly appreciated.

        Thank you for your attention to this matter.

        Best regards,

        Public Service Office
